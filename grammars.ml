TEST GRAMMARS FOR PARSING WITH ZIPPERS

   This file provides grammars and (simple) test examples to convince readers of
   the properties we claim about PwZ in our paper.

   Each grammar conforms to the Grammar module signature. This allows them to be
   kept separate and use similar naming conventions. We chose the first
   production of each grammar to be used as the `start` production.

   The grammars each have a comment above that explain the purpose of the
   grammar and show it written in a BNF format.

   Note that the BNF specifications use the unusual convention that lowercase
   letters represent non-terminals while capital letters represent terminals.

A NOTE ON LIMITATIONS IMPOSED BY OCAML

   The OCaml language features a number of limitations that prevent us from
   expressing grammars as succinctly and clearly as we would like. Namely, these
   are:

   1. Recursive record definitions must be completely static, i.e., we cannot use
      "smart constructors" to reduce syntactic overhead.
   2. Names of functions, values, and variables cannot begin with a capital
      letter. (We address this by prepending these names with an underscore.)
   3. Identifiers cannot contain non-ASCII characters. (This means we cannot use
      the ε character as an identifier.)

   2 and 3 are easy enough to deal with. However, 1 is more of a nuisance. One
   potential solution would be to write a syntax macro (e.g., using ppx) to
   allow for easier specification of recursive forms for defining grammars.
   Unfortunately, none of the authors is sufficiently skilled in the OCaml
   syntax system to implement this completely within the time limit afforded us
   by the author response. However, it is something we would like to provide.

(*
tok_list_of_string

   This function allows for easy conversion from a string to a list of tokens,
   useful for parsing the simple grammars encoded here.

   Each grammar contains an association list mapping single characters to token
   expressions. A string consisting solely of these characters can then be
   converted to a list of the token expressions.

   Note that the string cannot have any extraneous whitespace or other
   characters that are not defined in the association list.
*)
let tok_list_of_string (str : string) (assocs : (char * tok) list) : tok list =
  let limit = String.length str in

  let rec tok_list_of_string (idx : int) (acc : tok list) : tok list =
    if idx < limit
    then tok_list_of_string (idx + 1) ((List.assoc (String.get str idx) assocs) :: acc)
    else acc

  in List.rev (tok_list_of_string 0 [])

(*
Testing lists

   This record is used within each grammar definition to supply example strings
   that should either produce successful parses or should result in no parses.

   tests.success is a list of pairs. The first element of these pairs is a
   string, which is the test input. The second element is an optional integer.
   When this integer is present in a Some, its value corresponds to the number
   of trees the algorithm is expected to produce upon successful parsing. If the
   value is a None, then it is merely expected that the parse produces a
   positive result (i.e., there are more than 0 elements returned).

   tests.failure is a list of strings, which are simply test inputs. A failed
   parse is represented as an empty list in all cases, so no extra integer is
   needed for these.
*)
type tests = {
  success : (string * (int option)) list;
  failure : string list;
}

(*
Grammar module signature

   This module signature shows the interface through which all of the below
   grammars can be used.
*)
module type Grammar = sig
  val start : exp
  val tests : tests
end

(*
Token definitions

   These are simple definitions of type Types.tok. They are used by some of the
   grammars defined below.

   The association list maps characters to tokens. This list can be used by the
   tok_list_of_string function defined above in the conversion of strings to
   tokens.
*)
let t_A = (1, "A")
let t_B = (2, "B")

let tok_assoc = [('A', t_A); ('B', t_B)]

(*
parse

   This is a wrapper for the Pwz module's `parse` function.

   It takes two arguments: a Grammar module G (examples of which are defined
   below in this file) and a string. The string will be converted to a list of
   tokens according to the association list G.tokens. Then, the parse will
   proceed by starting at the G.start grammar expression.
*)

let parse ((module G) : (module Grammar)) (str : string) : exp list =
  Pwz.parse (tok_list_of_string str tok_assoc) G.start

(*
parse_to_ast

   This function wraps the above `parse` function.

   It converts the list of expressions produced by parsing into a list of AST
   elements. This is useful for separating ambiguous parse results into separate
   parse trees, instead of the `parse` function's result (which is often an Alt
   containing multiple children).

   NOTE: This function eagerly extracts expressions into AST nodes. Some of the
   below grammars are designed to produce an infinite number of resulting
   expressions, which means that this function would be tasked with producing an
   eager infinite list. We recommend against its use in these cases.
